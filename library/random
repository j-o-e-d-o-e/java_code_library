Random

built-in class

(1) init
    - Random(): sets seed to val very likely to be distinct from any other invocation of this constructor
    - Random(long seed): sets seed (initial value of the internal state) to seed
(2) single val
    - nextInt(int origin, int bound) returns int between origin (incl) and bound (excl)
        - if origin resp. bound not given, defaults to 0 resp. Integer.MAX_VALUE
        - if only one val given, bound is set
    - nextFloat(float origin, float bound) returns float between origin (incl) and bound (excl)
        - if origin resp. bound not given, defaults to 0.0 resp. 1.0
    - nextDouble(double origin, double bound) returns double between origin (incl) and bound (excl)
    - nextBoolean() returns either true or false
    - nextLong() returns long
(3) multiple vals
    - ints(long n, int origin, int bound) returns IntStream with n ints each between origin and bound
        - if no args or origin and bound not given, returns infinitive stream
    - doubles(long n, double origin, double bound) returns DoubleStream
    - longs(long n, long origin, long bound) returns DoubleStream

EXAMPLE
Random rand = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());
rand.ints(3, 0, 10).forEachOrdered(System.out::print);
