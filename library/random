Random

built-in class

- init
    - Random(): sets seed to val very likely to be distinct from any other invocation of this constructor
    - Random(long seed): sets seed (initial value of the internal state) to seed
- nextInt(int origin, int bound) returns int between origin (incl) and bound (excl)
    - if origin resp. bound not given, defaults to 0 resp. Integer.MAX_VALUE
    - if only one val given, bound is set
- nextFloat(float origin, float bound) returns float between origin (incl) and bound (excl)
    - if origin resp. bound not given, defaults to 0.0 resp. 1        
- nextDouble(double origin, double bound) returns double between origin (incl) and bound (excl)
- nextBoolean() returns either true or false
- nextLong() returns long
- ints(long n, int origin, int bound) returns IntStream with n ints each between origin and bound
    - if no args or origin and bound not given, returns infinitive stream
- doubles(long n, double origin, double bound) returns DoubleStream
- longs(long n, long origin, long bound) returns DoubleStream

EXAMPLE
Random rand = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());
rand.ints(3, 0, 10).forEachOrdered(System.out::print);
