do-while-loop



- similar to while-loop, except that a do-while-loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time
- boolean expression is at the end of the loop

EXAMPLE
public class Test {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int x = 10;

      do {
         System.out.print("value of x : " + x );
         x++;
         System.out.print("\n");
      }while( x < 20 );
   }
}
