Map->LinkedHashMap

data structure

- ordered subclass of HashMap<K, V>
    - unlike HashMap, maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries
    - maintains insertion order (by default, like List) or access order
- init (additionally to hashmap)
    - LinkedHashMap(int initCapacity, float loadFactor, boolean accessOrder)
        - accessOrder: if true, orders elems by access
            - from least-recently to most-recently accessed
            - if false, uses insertion order
